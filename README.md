# Pokédex

This is a website to get information about different Pokemon's. In this Website i used Pokédex API, to get the data. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website. The website is responsive and works on all devices. It represents the data in a very simple way. It is very easy to use and understand. It is a very user-friendly website. It represents the data as cards. Visit [here!](https://pokedex.nishan-singh.com/).
